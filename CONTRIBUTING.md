# Contributing
Welcome to the `sb3-burn` project! We're so excited you're interested in helping out.

At its heart, this is an unpaid passion project, and contributors are very welcome. If you think this project could be useful 
for your work, have a passion for reinforcement learning, or just want to learn some RL / burn / rust, then you may enjoy 
contributing. There are a few different ways you can contribute:

1. Trying to use the project, and providing feedback or creating issues for bugs / enhancements
2. Running the examples on different hardware and operating systems
3. Picking up a ticket and writing some code
4. Working on examples or documentation
5. Writing tests to improve coverage

## How to contribute
### Step 1: Review the Issue Tickets

Before you start working on a contribution, please take a moment to look through the open issues in the issue tracker for this project. This will give you an idea of what kind of work is currently being planned or is in progress.

### Step 2: Get Familiar with the Project Architecture

It's crucial to have an understanding of the project's architecture. Familiarize yourself with the structure of the project, the purpose of different components, and how they interact with each other. This will give you the context needed to make meaningful contributions.

### Step 3: Fork and Clone the Repository

Before you can start making changes, you'll need to fork the `sb3-burn` repository and clone it to your local machine. This can be done via the GitHub website or the GitHub Desktop application. Here are the steps:

1. Click the "Fork" button at the top-right of this page to create a copy of this project in your GitHub account.
2. Clone the repository to your local machine. You can do this by clicking the "Code" button on the GitHub website and copying the URL. Then open a terminal on your local machine and type git clone [the URL you copied].

### Step 4: Create a New Branch

It's a good practice to create a new branch for each contribution you make. This keeps your changes organized and separated from the main project, which can make the process of reviewing and merging your changes easier. You can create a new branch by using the command git checkout -b [branch-name].

### Step 5: Make Your Changes

Once you have set up your local repository and created a new branch, you can start making changes. Please ensure that all code changes are
covered by tests, that documentation is updated / created as required, and that all tests pass.

### Step 7: Submit a Pull Request

After you've made your changes, you're ready to submit a pull request. This can be done through the GitHub website or the GitHub Desktop application.

When submitting your pull request, please provide a brief description of the changes you've made and the issue or issues that your changes address.

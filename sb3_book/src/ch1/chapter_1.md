# What is sb3-rust?
`sb3_burn` is a library for Reinforcement Learning in Rust, using the 
[Burn](https://github.com/tracel-ai/burn) library.
It is loosely based on the Python/PyTorch library 
[Stable-Baselines3](https://github.com/DLR-RM/stable-baselines3/tree/master) 
(hence the name), but with a goal of speed, lightweight computation, and 
easy checkpointing/saving/loading.
